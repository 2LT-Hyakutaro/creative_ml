        "Deep learning is currently the most successful subfield of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain through artificial neural networks. It enables computers to learn from vast amounts of data and has revolutionized various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition.\n",

        "Deep architectures are essential because they allow models to learn hierarchical representations from raw input data. These hierarchical representations can capture increasingly complex and abstract features as the network depth increases. This capability enables deep learning models to achieve state-of-the-art results in many tasks, as they can automatically learn to extract relevant features from the input data without relying on hand-engineered features.\n",

        "\n",
        "As seen in the course, there are several impediments in learning deep architectures, namely\n",
        "1. Vanishing gradient\n",
        "2. Overfitting issues\n",
        "3. Multiple local minima\n",
        "4. Instability in the training\n",
        "Here, we briefly discuss the two major problems, namely _vanishing gradient_ and _overfitting_.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Vanishing gradient\n",
        "One of the main challenges in training deep architectures is the vanishing gradient problem. It occurs when gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters become too small as they backpropagate through the layers. This issue leads to slow convergence and poor performance, as the weights in the earlier layers do not get updated significantly during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Overfitting\n",
        "Another challenge in deep learning is overfitting, where the model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and weight decay, are used to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model or by making the training process more robust.\n",

        "### Layer-wise Pretraining\n",
        "To address the vanishing gradient problem and improve the training of deep architectures, layer-wise pretraining was proposed. In this approach, each layer of the deep architecture is pretrained independently, usually with unsupervised learning methods like autoencoders, before fine-tuning the entire network using supervised learning.\n",

        "#### Autoencoders\n",
        "_Autoencoders_ are unsupervised learning models that learn to reconstruct their input data. They consist of an encoder that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation. Autoencoders can be used to learn useful features from the data and initialize the weights of a deep architecture during layer-wise pretraining. As we have seen, an interesting variant of autoencoders are _denoising autoencoders_ that learn to reconstruct the input data from a corrupted version of it. By learning to recover the original data from the corrupted version, denoising autoencoders can capture more robust and meaningful features. They can be used in layer-wise pretraining to improve the training of deep architectures further."

Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models that can learn useful features from the input data. They consist of an encoder, which maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation. _Deep autoencoders_ are multi-layer autoencoders that can learn more abstract and complex features from the input data. To learn such models, _layer-wise training_ was historically used as a technique to help overcome the vanishing gradient problem and initializes the network with better weights, leading to improved performance. Hence, we aim to _pretrain each layer individually_ in an **unsupervised** manner, followed by fine-tuning the entire network with _supervised_ learning."

        "There are several variants of auto-encoders, such as denoising auto-encoders or variational auto-encoders. Each address some downside of the basic AE model. For instance, the deterministic nature of the basic auto-encoder implies a point-wise mapping of the latent space, meaning that not all the latent positions can be leveraged to produce relevant reconstructions. Because of this reason, there is no way to ensure that the latent space could allow a robust generalization and that any random $\\mathbf{z}$ would generate a meaningful output."

        "Here, we discuss how we can implement and train a simple auto-encoder network in Pytorch. As discussed earlier, an AE is composed of two parts, an **encoder** and a **decoder**. The goal of the encoder is to \"compress\" the dataset, representing its principal features with a very small code, while the goal of the decoder is to learn how to reproduce the initial input from this code. Hence, we will first need to use some basic imports and definition to setup our problem"

Here, we will start very basic and define the encoder and decoder as simple `Linear` layers. Note that we also use `BatchNorm`, `ReLU` and `Dropout` to regularize our training."
